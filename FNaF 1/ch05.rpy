    manager "Good morning, Mr. Schmidt.{w=0.2}\nYou seem to have done a good job watching the place."
    mike "And you seem have done a good job telling me that those things walk around at night!!"
    "I replied as I pointed at the show stage with fury."

    "His cheerful expression quickly faded at my reaction.{w=0.2}\nHe then let out a sigh."
    manager "Yes, I apologize for that, Mr. Schmidt;{w=0.2} I should have warned you about that."
    mike "And that's not all;{w=0.2} what's this bullshit about not filing a missing persons report until the place is cleaned up??"
    manager mad "Excuse me?"
    mike "Don't play dumb!{w=0.2} The guy who worked as a night guard before me told me about it!"
    mike "He left a message for me that explained everything!{w=0.2}\nThe legal notice, the animatronics moving, and even the part about them possibly killing me!!"
    manager normal "...{w=0.2}I see."
    manager sad "Yes, I haven't exactly been honest with you about everything, but if I had, you nor anyone else would take the job, hm?"
    mike "You're damn right!{w=0.2} And I ain't staying here at this job, either!{w=0.2}\nI quit!"
    manager normal "Hm.{w=0.5} Very well, then. I suppose that's to be expected."

    "I then stormed towards the front doors."
    manager "I'll see you tonight, Mr. Schmidt."
    "I paused with confusion before turning back towards him."

    mike "Didn't you hear me?{w=0.2} I said I quit!"
    manager mad "I heard you, Mr. Schmidt.{w=0.2} But as per your contract, you're still expected to come in tonight."
    mike "What the fuck do you mean?"
    manager "Ahem..."
    "He then pulled a piece of paper out of his pocket.{w=0.2} Glancing at it revealed it to be the contract I had signed 6 hours prior."
    manager normal "To quote Paragraph 5, section A:"
    manager "{i}{u}I understand that if I, the employee, ever wish to willingly end my employment at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, I am required to finish my current scheduled work week before leaving the company.{/u}{/i}"
    mike "What??{w=0.2}\nSo you're saying that if I wanna quit, which I do, then I can't until the end of the week??"
    manager "That's what the contract that you signed says."
    mike "Bullshit!{w=0.2} Let me see that!"
    "I swiped the contract from his hands and looked at the part he was referring to."
    "My heart sunk when I saw, written clear as day, the words he had just stated."
    mike "That's not right!{w=0.2} I didn't see that when I signed it!"
    manager mad "You looked at the contract before signing.{w=0.2}\nIf you missed or misread anything, that's not my fault."
    mike "Well, then what's stopping me from just doing this?"

    "I then ripped the contract clean in half, sporting a large, cocky grin."
    "However, the manager was completely unphased."
    manager "Other than the fact that was a copy of your contract and that the authentic one is under safekeeping?{w=0.2} Nothing."
    "This bastard's thought of everything, hasn't he?{w=0.2}\nI get the feeling I'm far from the first to be in this predicament."
    manager normal "Now, I suppose you had better finish your next 4 shifts, Mr. Schmidt, unless you want to be the victim of a lawsuit."
    mike "Are you threatening me??"
    manager "I am merely stating a fact.{w=0.2} Paragraph 5, section B:"
    manager "{i}{u}I understand that if I, the employee, fail to finish my current scheduled work week upon my announcement of leaving the company, I am liable to a breach of contract lawsuit.{/u}{/i}"
    "All I could do was just stare, completely powerless to the situation."
    "I finally just continued towards the front door of the building."
