    macey "Come on, Mike! You can't sit on this couch forever!"
    mike "Yes, I can!"
    "I replied without taking my eyes off the TV."
    "She stood in front of the TV to try and block it."
    macey "You really think you're going to make money by watching TV all day?"
    "I adjusted my head to look around her before replying:"
    mike "I'm sure it's possible somewhere."
    macey "Well, it's not possible here!"
    "She then shut off the TV and bent down to look me eye-to-eye."
    macey "Look, when you dropped out of high school, I was the only one who was more or less on your side. You remember that, right?"
    mike "Of course."
    "Where exactly is she going with this?"
    macey "To this day, Mom still tells me that letting you live with me is being too generous, that I'm doing nothing but coddle you and letting you take my hospitality for granted."
    macey "And while I disagree with how she worded it, she's not exactly wrong, Mike."
    mike "What, you're not going to kick me out, are you?"
    macey "No.{w=0.5} But I am going to kick you in the pants harder than I have been. {w=0.2}Which was basically not at all."
    mike "Can't it wait some other time?"
    "I reached for the remote, but she grabbed my wrist tightly."
    mike "Ow!{w=0.2} What are you--"
    macey "Mike."
    "She had an uncharacteristically serious expression on her face."
    macey "I'm being serious here.{w=0.2} I'd appreciate it if you were, too."
    "I sighed and nodded, signalling for her to continue."
    "She let go of my wrist and regained her composure."
    macey "I promised Mom that I would help you have a successful life. {w=0.2}And you're never going to have that if you don't start with at least getting a job somewhere."
    mike "Mace, you know me.{w=0.2} I'm not really a hard-working guy."
    macey "I know.{w=0.2} But Mom's getting really impatient, Mike. Do you really want to keep looking her in the eye and telling her that your life situation has in no way improved?"
    "I stared at her in thought for a few seconds."
    "As much as I hated working, I hated disappointing my mom even more."
    mike "Okay, fine.{w=0.2} I'll at least look at what's being offered."
    macey "That's the spirit!"

    Looking back, I really don't know what I was thinking when I decided to drop out of high school.

    I guess maybe I thought I was being rebellious against the high standards my family had for me?

    Regardless of the reason, that was around 3 years ago now, and things aren't exactly going well for me, as Macey said.

    I've got no job or money, I'm crashing at my sister's apartment, and my parents are heavily disappointed in me.

    I suppose it hasn't been the worst of experiences so far, but deep down, I know I can do better.

    Or maybe I just want to prove Mom and Dad right.{w=0.2} That I actually CAN amount to something in life.

    Either way, the time for mooching is over.{w=0.2} I gotta try and find a job somewhere.
